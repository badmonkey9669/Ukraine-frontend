Ukraine has barely enough Javelins to equip an army brigade; it has nearly 30 brigades as well as an assortment of smaller units, reservists, and special operations forces. Fully outfitting the Ukrainian Ground Forces with Javelins would require something on the order of 1,500 CLUs and 5,000 or more missiles.",
